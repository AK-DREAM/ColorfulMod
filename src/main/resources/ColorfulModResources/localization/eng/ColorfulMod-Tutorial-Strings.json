NL Weak Color Effect ( #yWCE ) : Only triggers its #yEvoke #yEffect. NL NL When a colored card is played , trigger #ySCE and remove its color. NL When a colored card is colored again, trigger #yWCE and replace the color. NL At the end of turn , if a card is NOT #yretained , trigger #yWCE and remove its color. NL NL Only cards of this character can be colored.",
      "Easy version: You #yDON'T need to play a card to trigger its color effect, because the effect will automatically trigger when its color is replaced or the turn has end. However, playing a colored card will trigger the strengthen effect of ALL other colored cards in your hand. NL Don't worry if you didn't fully understand, just go and play!
